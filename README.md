# Final Project
# The Trendy Recipe 🍽

  
Today's easy access to the internet makes our life better in many ways. Personally, I use it everyday to figure out new meal ideas and recipes, my imagination can only do so much in the kitchen. I always think...if they could just tell me what I could cook with what I have...I could save so much time. So the goal of this project is to fulfill that need.

It has also become apparent to me that people, just like with clothes, follow trends with food. Ingredients like avocado, quinoa or tofu have recently become protagonists of these dishes.
I thought it could be interesting to find out the 'trendiness' of a recipe. How many people look that recipe up?

### OBJECTIF: Based on the ingredients you have at home, propose multiple recepies you could make and the 'trendiness' of each one of them.
